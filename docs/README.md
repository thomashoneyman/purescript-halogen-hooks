# Hooks Documentation

Halogen Hooks is a new library for Halogen, but Hooks as a concept were originally pioneered by React. The structure of this documentation is adapted from the [React Hooks documentation](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) and many of the core ideas are the same.

You should read [Introducing Halogen Hooks](https://thomashoneyman.com/articles/introducing-halogen-hooks) before diving in to this documentation.

If you reach a portion of this documentation which is incomplete, you may benefit from reading a similar section in the React documentation. I also encourage you to reach out on this repository's issue tracker about the information you wanted to know but couldn't find in this documentation.

The [Hooks Internals](./09-Hooks-Internals.md) documentation can help you if you would like to contribute to this library and need to understand its design decisions.
