      You will see '-trace.json' profiles deposited to the test/ directory for
      each test in the performance benchmark. You can load any of these profiles
      into the Chrome dev tools to manually examine the performance trace (for
      example, to verify the numbers or to review the flamechart).

      Note: Chrome's processing speed can vary widely from machine to machine.
      Compare numbers from the master branch on your machine against your test
      branch on your machine, or rely on comparative numbers between the component
      and hooks implementations.
